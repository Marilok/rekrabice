/**
 * This was originally written due to react making sync `react-dom/server` APIs
 * legacy and making it almost impossible for this component to be used on NextJS 14
 * but this also makes the Tailwind component faster due to the fact that it runs through
 * the elements and directly converts props into attributes and element names into
 * tag names.
 *
 * This also renders the components by calling them directly and then using their returned value
 * to compute the rest of the HTML markup tree.
